In C++, variables are containers for storing data values. Each variable has a specific data type that determines what kind of data it can store. The most common data types include:

1. Integer (int): Used for whole numbers like 42 or -17
2. Double: For decimal numbers like 3.14159 or -0.001
3. Character (char): For single characters like 'A' or '7'
4. Boolean (bool): For true/false values
5. String (string): For text like "Hello World"

When declaring variables, you must specify the data type followed by the variable name. For example:
int age = 25;
This creates an integer variable named 'age' and assigns it the value 25.

Remember to always initialize your variables to prevent undefined behavior in your programs.
